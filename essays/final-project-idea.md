### Overview

Our idea for our final project will be to create an application that allows its users to share photos that they've taken on campus with each other. The problem is that there exists no platform that exists solely for sharing pictures that people take on the UH Manoa campus. There are social media platforms that people can share these photos on, however these platforms also contain other kinds of posts that aren't on campus, as well as advertisements that distract from the experience. The solution would be to create that platform that exists solely for sharing photos taken on the UH Manoa Campus.

### Mockup Ideas
Our application should include a login page, a feed page, a share page, and a profile page.

The login page is the simplist, as it allows users to create profiles to foster connections within the UH Manoa community. The profile page will include profile customization options, but also include all of the user's posts, allowing them to edit or remove them if needed. The feed page contains posts from all other users, and the share page is the page that allows the user to create a new post.

### Use Cases
This application's purpose is to fulfill a niche that does not yet exist in today's social media platforms. As a result, the biggest use case of this application is to share a funny, cool, or nice photo of someone or something on campus to other people who also attend UH Manoa.


### Beyond The Basics

Although this application seems easy to make at first, there are some things to consider. First, how do we verify that a user is from UH Manoa? Since this application is solely for photos on campus, only people who attend UH Manoa should be able to view and share posts. Second, are there ways we can allow users to categorize their postings, in order to better organize the feed?
