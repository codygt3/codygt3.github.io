Hello everyone! I'm Cody Torres, and as of writing this essay, I'm in my second year of College at UH Manoa. I've gotten a bit of experience in programming and development, and would like to share my background with you!

### Who I Am

My interest in computer science sparked way back when I was just a kid playing computer games on his laptop. Video games were a huge part of my life growing up, and because I was interested in computer games, I needed to learn how to use a computer and download games from the internet in order to play them. I played games like Minecraft and Roblox, both of which aren't just browser games and taught me how to manage files and install programs. I was interested in modding Minecraft as well, so I got a lot of experience in navigating the internet for files as well as learning what and what not to click on to avoid viruses (I learned the hard way many times). My childhood cemented my interest in computers and technology because I had loved video games very much and was much more capable of using computers when given chromebooks at school compared to other students. 

As for where I am today, I've taken a couple courses in both high school and college to better understand how to not only utilize but create programs. I took AP computer science classes in high school that taught me how to program in Python and Java, then took more college courses which taught me C, C++, Javascript, and I even learned how to use HTML and CSS from the coding mentorship club ICSpark! As it turns out, I ended up becoming the president of that club and now serve as a mentor in computer science for students across the island.

### The Future

I still have a couple more years to go before I really start getting competent at programming and development, but I'm not worried at all. Some things I'm looking forward to learning are making use of libraries such as React and learning how to work in a team using GitHub. I want to make a website that I'm really proud of using React. I've made websites before, but nothing that I was super proud of or something that would be super useful, so a goal I've set for myself is to make a functioning website I can happily display in my portfolio. I also wish to get a taste of using GitHub in a group development environment, I find using the command line to make commits and pushes to be ultra satisfying and makes me feel like the real deal, but I won't know how it feels until I've gotten a big project done as a group! I'm looking forward to how I'll sharpen my development skills in the future!
