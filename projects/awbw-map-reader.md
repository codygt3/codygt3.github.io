This was a personal project I worked on during my first year at UH Manoa. Advance Wars By Web, or AWBW, is an online turn-based strategy game where two players battle each other by building armies and capturing cities. They play this game on a map that determines where cities are located, where unit deployment bases are positioned, as well as positions of oceans, mountains, forests, roads, etc. Analyzing the map before the game starts is crucial, because players must choose between a variety of Commanding Officers, or COs, with different abilities that can become stronger or weaker depending on the map. I developed this program to scan a map's tiles and output it as an array to be used in a future project.

As this was a personal project, I worked completely independently. The biggest reason I started this project was to understand how to use GitHub. I know Git and Github are very important tools in the development world, and I needed to get familiar with them as I will be working with them in the future. I learned how to pull a repository from GitHub to Visual Studio Code, and also learned how to make commits and push them through the command line, which felt really nice.

I will admit that this project was quite small and doesn't serve much of a purpose on it's own, but I had made plans to use this project to help develop other useful programs to help me in Advance Wars. One such idea I had was to make a program that would take the map data and calculate the amount of days it would take for an infantry unit to reach a certain city, given that infantry captured any other cities along the way. If I find the time, I feel it would be a fun exercise in developing a path finding algorithm. 

The project's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/stickstetris/AWBW-Map-Reader).
