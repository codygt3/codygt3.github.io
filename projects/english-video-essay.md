summary: "A video essay on how to start playing fighting games"
---

For my final project in ENG 100, I was tasked with creating a multimodal essay, which is an essay that also has another element besides writing to it. I chose to make a video essay, since I am very comfortable with video editing, and I chose a topic that interested me. The video is a guide on how to start playing fighting games, which is a genre of video game that is dear to my heart.

This project was my own final project, however I did have the chance to peer review other classmate's essays and have them peer review my project. I had learned how to give proper constructive criticism, as well as how to take advantage of a peer review to catch any mistakes or holes in my project that I may have missed on my own. One peer had told me that they had trouble understanding what certain terminology I was using meant, and I transformed that into a section in my video explaining how to find definitions for fighting game terms. 

This video essay also taught me how to incorporate the ideas of other video creators into my video to help illustrate a point. I had already been familiar with citing sources and quoting information to help formulate an argument, but I had never done this kind of citation in a video format before. I also learned how to plan out what to show on the video during every word I said to visualize the points I am conveying. For example, I was making a point that complicated combos aren't integral to learn when new to the genre, and made sure the video was showing an example of a simple combo that is beginner friendly. 

The video I made can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqcKBpkVuJk), and is also embedded below.
