This was a personal project I worked on during my first year at UH Manoa. Advance Wars By Web, or AWBW, is an online turn-based strategy game where two players battle each other by building armies and capturing cities. They play this game on a map that determines where cities are located, where unit deployment bases are positioned, as well as positions of oceans, mountains, forests, roads, etc. Analyzing the map before the game starts is crucial, because players must choose between a variety of Commanding Officers, or COs, with different abilities that can become stronger or weaker depending on the map. I developed this program to scan a map's tiles and output it as an array to be used in a future project.

As this was a personal project, I worked completely independently. The biggest reason I started this project was to understand how to use GitHub. I know Git and Github are very important tools in the development world, and I needed to get familiar with them as I will be working with them in the future. I learned how to pull a repository from GitHub to Visual Studio Code, and also learned how to make commits and push them through the command line, which felt really nice.

The project's GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/stickstetris/AWBW-Map-Reader).

Note that the account holder of this repository is my personal account, given that this was a personal project.
